# CODE OF CONDUCT
---

## Team ethics

I embrace that we are stronger as a cross-functional team, working towards a shared goal;

I will share my knowledge and expertise with other developers and help them grow, much like other developers helped me grow;

I will treat the people in my team as I would like to be treated by them;
I will guide others to embrace and adhere to these principles;

I embrace that software development is a complex endeavor, requiring frequent and intense communication with my team and stakeholders to clarify both the problem and the solution;

I accept (and will help others accept) that mistakes are inevitable. Instead of trying to avoid mistakes altogether, I will seek to limit their impact and learn from them to avoid similar mistakes in the future;

I will continuously improve myself.

I will do the best I can.


## Team participation

I will not be late for team meetings.

I will help make the work for a product transparent so that we can make informed decisions about what still needs to be done and in what order;

I will help prioritize work for a product based on the value it has for the business, not on (my) personal preferences, likes or dislikes;

I will ask for help when Iâ€™m stuck and motivate others to do the same;

I will ask for help when I need it.

I will provide help when asked.

## Peer reviews
I will be professional and tactful when providing review comments.

I will be open to receiving feedback when others review my work.

## Writing code
I will express myself through code.

I will add comments to code only if I have failed to express myself through code.

I will write code that adheres to my team's formatting and style conventions.

I will not submit production code without thorough in-memory unit tests.

I will not submit code that causes any tool to emit a warning.

I will always help to find a balance between the need for urgency and the need for quality.
